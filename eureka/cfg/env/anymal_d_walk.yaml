description: The primary goal of the policy is to enable the quadruped robot to accurately track randomly chosen x, y, and yaw velocity commands on flat and slightly uneven terrain (and ONLY this type of terrain).
  In addition to precise velocity tracking, the policy should optimize several secondary objectives crucial for real-world deployment, such as
  - Energy efficiency to extend runtime.
  - Smooth and controlled footstep swings to prevent excessive wear on hardware (rapid foot movements can cause damage).
  - Low-impact foot contacts to minimize stress on the robot's structure.
  - Stability against small external disturbances to enhance robustness.
  While these secondary objectives may sometimes conflict, the policy should strike a balance to ensure safe, efficient, and reliable locomotion on real hardware.
