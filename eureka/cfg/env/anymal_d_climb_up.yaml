description: Main goal of the policy is to make the quadruped follow randomly chosen x,y, and yaw target velocities.
  This class corresponds to the Staircase Ascent Locomotion task. The environment consists of a quadruped robot navigating up a 
  staircase with consistent step heights and moderate inclines. The goal is to learn a stable and natural climbing gait that 
  allows the robot to ascend efficiently without excessive energy expenditure. The robot should exhibit a slight forward lean to
  maintain balance and prevent backward tipping. 
  Foot placements should be precise and well-timed to ensure consistent contact with each stair, avoiding missteps or slipping.
  The gait should be controlled and deliberate, with smooth, coordinated leg movements to prevent excessive joint strain and maintain 
  continuous forward momentum. Foot swings should be just high enough to clear each step while minimizing unnecessary motion. 
  The robot should use its body posture and momentum effectively, distributing weight appropriately between the front and rear legs to ensure stability on inclined surfaces.
  Robustness to minor perturbations is essentialâ€”if the robot encounters slight variations in stair height or surface texture, 
  it should be able to adapt and recover rather than stumbling. The final policy should prioritize safety, efficiency, and real-world deployability, 
  minimizing high-impact forces and excessive torque spikes while maintaining a confident and fluid climbing motion.
