description: Goal of the policy: to make the quadruped follow randomly chosen x,y, and yaw target velocities.
  This class corresponds to the Flat Terrain Locomotion task. 
  The environment consists of a quadruped robot navigating across a flat and sometimes 
  slightly uneven surface, aiming to achieve a natural and stable walking gait. 
  The policy should generate graceful and energy-efficient movements, ensuring that foot swings 
  are not too rapid and impact forces remain low to facilitate real-world deployment. 
  Stability is prioritized, with minimal oscillations or erratic body motions. 
  The learned gait should be robust to small disturbances, allowing smooth recovery from minor 
  external forces or surface variations. The final motion should be safe for deployment, 
  avoiding excessive torque spikes or unnatural joint configurations. 
  The policy should optimize for a smooth, flowing gait with a balance between efficiency and adaptability, 
  ensuring the robot moves confidently and predictably across its environment.
